# FizzGUI
A simple java based GUI system for Java Monkey Engine 3 that uses texture atlases 


###Introduction
This GUI system is modular rather than plug-n-play.  It is intended to be used from the source so that it can be edited by the end user.

Personally, I use KENNEY's texture atlases (Space UI and Gray UI) when I create GUIs with FizzGUI.  However, any texture atlas will work.
